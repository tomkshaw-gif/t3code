/**
 * The OpenCode 2 runtime behind the `opencode` driver. It talks to the
 * instance's `opencode serve` process through the HTTP client and reads that
 * server's `/api/event` stream, routed here by session id.
 *
 * A turn is one `session.prompt`; the session's next `session.execution.*`
 * terminal ends it. Each runtime mode is a set of session permission rules,
 * and OpenCode's permission asks and question forms become runtime requests
 * on the asking session's thread, a subagent's on its parent's.
 *
 * A `subagent` call runs in a child session shown as a subagent thread. A
 * background one outlives its turn; when it ends, OpenCode starts a parent
 * execution T3 did not ask for, which waits here for the continuation turn T3
 * opens for it. Steering, fork, rollback and compaction arrive in later
 * layers, and the capabilities below say no.
